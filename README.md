# Multiple Indicies Affect on Unemployment Rate

## Obejective of this Analysis
The objective of this anlysis is to examine the affect of multiple economic indicies on the unemployment rate in the US. The unemployment rate will be the dependent variable for this analysis whereas the following variables will serve as the independent variables; Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Producer Price Index (PPI), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Federal Fund Rate, and the National Interest Rate. The machine leaning technique this analysis will employ will consist of a linear regression to explore the relationship between the selected indicies and the dependent variable.   

## Data Sources:
For this analysis, we have 6 different CSV datasets. Each dataset represents a factor that we want to analyze in relation to the Unemployment Rate. This includes CPI, PPI, GDP, Inflation Rate, and the Federal Fund Rate.

## Data
Tools: 
Python, SQL, Supervised Machine Learning, Tableau, Jupyter Notebook

We mapped our data, which can is shown in the ERD below:

We are using PgAdmin SQL to create our database. The database was created with 6 tables from each csv file and joined into a new table called Unemployment_table seen below. We used the code below to join 6 tables by using 5 left joins.

## Communication Protocols
Team will communicate with Slack and groupchat via phone numbers. GitHub will be used to communicate our commits. Along with meeting during our class periods on Monday and Wednesday from 7pm-9pm, we will meet Friday evenings, 7pm-9pm, and Saturday mornings, 9am-12pm.

## Selected Topic
The selected topic is to analyze the relationship between Unemployment Rate and Federal Funds Interest Rates. Specifically, we want to predict how Federal Funds Interest Rates change will affect Unemployment Rate.

## Reason of Selected Topic
Unemployment in America has been volatile in the US over the past 20 years. Major events such as the housing market crash of 2009 and the COVID pandemic have affected the employment of many Americans that have lived through these events. The purpose for our analysis is to examine and identify the major economic indicators that may influence the unemployment rate in the US. By understanding these relationships, we hope to better understand how our individual industries that we work in may contribute to the volatility of the unemployement rate year over year.  

## Questions We Want Answered
1. Which indicies had the largest impact on the Unemployment Rate over the past 20 years?
2. What is the measured change of each index over the stated time period? 

## Machine Learning Model Requirements
* Preliminary Data Preprocessing
    * For MultipleLinearRegression, preliminary data preprocessing begins with making sure our data from our PostgresSQL database table is loaded into a dataframe and is all in numerical values. Because the date column was not initially a numerical value, we formatted its data type into an integer. The next step was to scale the unemployment dataframe from 0 to 1 with the MinMaxScaler module. Once scaled, the features set and target set from the unemployment database are defined. The features set entails the following columns: GDP, PPI, Inflation_Rate, CPI, Interest Rates. The target set is the unemployment_rate column.
* Preliminary Feature Engineering & Preliminary Feature Selection
    * Because our data contains continuous variables from 2001 to 2021, we decided to use Multiple Linear Regression. This feature selection takes in a set of factors and attempts to learn their patterns on a specific value, in this case, unemployment rate.
* How Data was Split
    * The data was split into training and testing sets before it was fit for MultipleLinearRegression with 75% of the data being for training and the other 25% was testing.
* Limitations and Benefits
    * A benefit of Multiple Linear Regression is if new data feature points are added, Linear Regression can be used to predict the result of unemployment rate. A limitation is it might present how there is no relationship with the data if there is no linear slope.
