# Multiple Indicies Affect on Unemployment Rate

## Obejective of this Analysis
The objective of this anlysis is to examine the affect of multiple economic indicies on the unemployment rate in the US. The unemployment rate will be the dependent variable for this analysis whereas the following variables will serve as the independent variables; Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Producer Price Index (PPI), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Federal Fund Rate, and the National Interest Rate. The machine leaning technique this analysis will employ will consist of a linear regression to explore the relationship between the selected indicies and the dependent variable.   

## Data Sources:
For this analysis, we have 6 different CSV datasets. Each dataset represents a factor that we want to analyze in relation to the Unemployment Rate. This includes CPI, PPI, GDP, Inflation Rate, and the Federal Fund Rate.

## Data Tools: 
Python, SQL, Supervised Machine Learning, Tableau, Jupyter Notebook

## Communication Protocols
Team will communicate with Slack and groupchat via phone numbers. GitHub will be used to communicate our commits. Along with meeting during our class periods on Monday and Wednesday from 7pm-9pm, we will meet Friday evenings, 7pm-9pm, and Saturday mornings, 9am-12pm.

## Selected Topic
The selected topic is to analyze the relationship between Unemployment Rate and Federal Funds Interest Rates. Specifically, we want to predict how Federal Funds Interest Rates change will affect Unemployment Rate.

## Reason of Selected Topic
Unemployment in America has been volatile in the US over the past 20 years. Major events such as the housing market crash of 2009 and the COVID pandemic have affected the employment of many Americans that have lived through these events. The purpose for our analysis is to examine and identify the major economic indicators that may influence the unemployment rate in the US. By understanding these relationships, we hope to better understand how our individual industries that we work in may contribute to the volatility of the unemployement rate year over year.  

## Questions We Want Answered
1. How does Federal Funds Interest Rates affect Unemployment Rate within the past X amount of years?
2. How do we predict this relationship to continue in future years?
3. What other factors relationship with Unemployment Rate?
4. Which relationship has the greatest amount of change?
